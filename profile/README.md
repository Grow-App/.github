# Welcome to the Grow app

Earth is a planet full of life. Plants, animals, fungi, bacteria. All of the creatures on this planet know how to find food, water and shelter. Except one, humans. 

Humans have huge brains for problem solving. We have created written language for knowledge transfer. As a result, Humanity has developed systems, technology, and tools to make survival easier.

Over thousands of years, humanity has created a framework that seemingly makes life easier, more convenient, less scary. All a person has to do is sign up to become a Consumer. 

Consumers are allowed to trade their time for money. This money can be used to buy whatever they might need - or not need.

For hundreds of years, most of humanity has signed up to become a Consumer without consideration for other options. The idea of fast food, bottled drinks, big cities and constant entertainment seems an attractive one. 

And the alternative is a scary thought. People donâ€™t know how to find food, clean water, build houses, or produce their own energy. People have forgotten their common unity. The Consumer had replaced Community. 

Indeed, this system of dependence has been the only option for many years. To become a Consumer, to fall in line, to feed the beast instead of feed oneself.

And then, a choice was born. A choice inspired by nature, by the animals around. People can now choose a new path, they can become a Grower.
